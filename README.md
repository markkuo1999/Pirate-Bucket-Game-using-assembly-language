The game is a party game released in 1979. The game process is exciting and interesting. During the game, players take turns to insert a small sword into the pirate barrel. If it touches the mechanism after inserting it, the pirate will pop out of the barrel. Players who let the pirates be ejected will be eliminated. The game continues until the players are eliminated one after another and only one player is alive. That player also becomes the winner of the game.

Our game supports two player dual of the pirate bucket game.
